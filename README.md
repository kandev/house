This is prototype of supposedly smart house controller.
Focus on Arduino Due and Arduino Mega2560 as they have enough i/o and interrupts. Supposedly will be connected via USB and RS232/9600 will be used for communication.

ESP8266 and ESP32 are not an option as they use wifi connection. There are no waves which are secure!
